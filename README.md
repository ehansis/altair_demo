# altair_demo
This is a collection of demo notebooks for plotting in Python with Altair/Vega-Lite.

## Installation

To get started with Altair, follow the [instructions in the Altair documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html).

If you are using [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) for managing your Python packages and environments, the following one-liner will set up a new environment `altair` for you and install the required packages:
```bash
conda create -n altair -c conda-forge python=3.7 altair vega_datasets jupyterlab
```
This uses JupyterLab. After installation you can launch a new session with
```bash
jupyter lab
```

If you want to programatically save `svg` or `png` versions of your graphs, you'll need to also install
the `selenium` Python package and the `chromedriver` executable - see [the Altair docs](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/saving_charts.html) or ask [your favourite search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=install+chromedriver) for help.
